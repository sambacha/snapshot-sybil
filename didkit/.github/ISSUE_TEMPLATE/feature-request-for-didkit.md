**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]

A quick stroll through the glossary section on our developer portable or in the /docs/ folder can help use the crispest terminology to be as explicit as possible, i.e., don't assume every VC `subject` is the `holder` of that VC in all cases, not all `issuers` are web servers, etc etc.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. If possible, describe the exact "home" of the feature (a new library, a new method, etc) and how it would change UX/ergonomics.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. Bonus points if you can think of a comparable project or product made by another team and link to its documentation or screengrab.

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.
